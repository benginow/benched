    /// Letâ€™s walk through how Coyote can easily solve the programming problem posed by Tom Cargill. He
    /// shared a BoundedBuffer implementation written in Java with a known, but tricky, deadlock bug.
    ///
    /// The BoundedBuffer implements a buffer of fixed length with concurrent writers adding items to
    /// the buffer and readers consuming items from the buffer. The readers wait if there are no items
    /// in the buffer and writers wait if the buffer is full, resuming only once a slot has been
    /// consumed by a reader. This is also known as a producer/consumer queue.
    ///
    /// The concrete ask was for the community to find a particular bug that Cargill knew about in the
    /// above program. The meta-ask was to come up with a methodology for catching such bugs rapidly.
    // Unlike in the C# and Java code, Rust doesn't have monitors. But a monitor is just a Mutex and a
    // Condvar anyway, so we implement it that way instead. Some of this code is not idiomatic Rust,
    // but is written this way to match the C# code more closely.
